# Use this script for empirical calculation of robot to camera transform 
# for each pose sensor configuration using fixed target measured 
# from robot and targetPose averages from PhotonVision.

# Steps:
# 1) Place the robot in a fixed position with the target camera facing 
# a single AprilTag target with the center of robot precisely aligned 
# with the center of the AprilTag (so that the Y translation below is zero).
# Best approach is to create a rectangle on the floor with gaffer tape 
# with the robot frame parallel on one side and the AprilTag (mounted) 
# on the other side to ensure the two are parallel.

# 2) Accurately measure the distance from the center of the robot to
# the face of the AprilTag to set the X translation value below.

# 3) Accurately measure the distance from the floor (base of the roobt)
# to the center of the AprilTag to set the Z translation value below.

# 4) Using PhotonVision web UI, confirm that the target AprilTag is being
# detected and the target translation values are being reported correctly.

# 5) Using AdvantageScope, connect to the robot and expand the photonvision
# topic, then expand the camera name being calculated, then expand to the 
# "targetPose", and finally expand both translation and rotation/quaternion. 
# Create a new "Statistics" panel in AdvantageScope with an empty "Measurements" 
# section. Under both translation and rotation sections under targetPose, drag each 
# individual value into the Measurements section so that the calculation of 
# median averages can begin. Wait at least 30 seconds for the Median value for each
# translation (x, y, z) and rotation (w, x, y, z) property to settle. Use each of 
# those Median values to set the appropriate constant value in the script 
# below for target to camera transform calculation.

# 6) After all of the script constant values have been set, save the script
# and open a new Terminal window in VSCode (do not commit the script changes in git). 
# After the Python virtual environment activates, copy, paste, and execute the 
# script with the following command: 
# python .\lib\scripts\calculateRobotToCameraTransform.py

# 7) Copy the Transform3d value that is printed to the terminal console and 
# paste it into the appropriate place in the robot constants for the associated 
# pose sensor configuration being calculated here.

# Example output from example values below: 
# Transform3d(Translation3d(0.149506, -0.055318, 0.271137), Rotation3d(-0.001852, -0.181301, 0.020370))

# 8) Repeat this same process from step 1 above for all other pose sensor cameras on the robot.

# Note: the constant values below are for example only - see the steps above for setting real/correct values.
